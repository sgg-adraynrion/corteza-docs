== Usage

=== Basic filtering
The filter dialog contains three main fields by which you can filter your records

* with first one you select the actual field name that contains the value by which you want to filter your fields
* second one is an operator field  where you can select three values "Equal", "Not equal" and "Contains"
* third field is where you enter the actual search value

=== Filtering with multiple parameters

The filter dialog allows the use of multiple search parameters to help you find the data that you are looking for. Clicking on a `+Add` button located below your first search parameter line will create a second search line

* you are able to determine how you want to join your two search parameters by selecting the option `and` or `or` in a newly created select field

Once you set a filter the filter icon will change its color and you will be able to know for which columns you have set filters.

== Delete filter


Filters can be deleted by clicking on a delete icon. If you have multiple search parameters you will have to delete them all in order to remove the filter, once the filters are deleted the filter icon in the record list will change its state to default value.
